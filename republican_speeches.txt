Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, rise a Climate Solutions Caucus speak issue climate change. caucus a bipartisan committed implementing economically viable options reduce climate risk. caucus a ``Noah's Ark'' membership rule. join pairs, party. leadership co-chairs Mr. Curbelo Mr. Deutch, caucus helping break partisan gridlock issue promoting climate solutions truly bipartisan. formation rapid growth Climate Solutions Caucus represents a recognition challenges opportunities demonstrated bipartisan action. recognition 60 Congress fight climate change a bipartisan fashion, organized time colleagues join floor American people we, elected leaders, doing address climate change. know, scientific evidence, climate changing. global average temperature increased 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit 100 years. Sea levels rising, ocean becoming acidic, precipitation patterns changing, heat waves becoming frequent duration. changes produces a cascade effects impact lives livelihoods, including flooding, changes crop yields, power shortages, declines fisheries, increases cardiovascular disease. Recent events own country, devastating hurricanes Southeast wildfires West brought issue forefront everyone's minds. climate change can't directly blamed problems, evidence strongly suggests contributes them, limit effects. Climate change a significant impact public health. A groundbreaking study published week a medical journal, Lancet, unequivocally climate change a serious public health threat. study involved 24 institutions world included staggering statistics, air pollution caused 1.9 million premature deaths Asia 2015, range common disease-transmitting mosquitoes increased 9.5 percent 1950. temperatures exasperate health burning fossil fuels creates pollution causes cardiovascular disease. National Academies estimate air pollution causes $120 billion health-related damages, including healthcare costs, missed days school, premature death. changing climate altered range, some accelerated spread vector-borne diseases likes Zika West Nile virus. Responsibly transitioning a clean energy economy reduce greenhouse gas emissions contribute climate change, reduce air pollution help Americans breathe easier. talk a minutes, some colleagues, a common misperception relationship implementing climate solutions growing jobs.

Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, yield 2 minutes distinguished gentleman California (Mr. Costa).


Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, thank friend colleague Minnesota, Congressman Peterson, yielding time. clear, think, Chamber devastating fires been, California recent weeks throughout West, years. overdue Congress address issues facing forests Federal management, legislation attempts do. mismanagement contributed rise catastrophic wildfires, home California throughout West. heart simple: money Congress allocated prevent wildfires instead out. Now, factors involved sure, densely overgrown forests managing set ourselves allow densely overgrown forests subject destructive fires wrong; and, course, lightning strikes natural conditions cause fires. alone, United Forest Service spent $2.4 billion putting fires transferred nearly $576 million management activities. management activities thinning forests allow overall growth. a preventive means decrease ability fires grow. concerns some provisions legislation believe improved some modifications, specifically fire borrowing addressed size categorical exemptions public disclosure laws, a progress, deal that. clear. reform Federal forests managed, particularly impacts a result changing climate pronounced, drought conditions.

Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, yield 2 minutes distinguished gentleman Virginia (Mr. Beyer).


Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, don't strong objections bill deal forest resilience, yield people a lot forests do. am concerned H.R. 2936 harmful species rely forests habitat bill specifically includes provisions specifically attack undermine Endangered Species Act. bill allows Forest Service Bureau Land Management unilaterally determine authorized logging forestry management actions adversely affect listed species critical habitat consulting experts U.S. Fish Wildlife Service required Endangered Species Act. Furthermore, bill declares that, purposes ESA, logging forestry activities carried pursuant bill ``nondiscretionary'' actions.

Fires burned close 300,000 acres, killed 43 people, forced 100,000 people evacuate, decimated some 7,000 homes, left 10,000 people homeless city Santa Rosa alone. fires didn't burn Forest Service lands didn't start public land, bill discussing prevented devastation district. agree doing prepare catastrophic fire events, bill doesn't achieve goal. Instead, guts longstanding protections fails fix budgetary issues plague fire management. fact, bill worse creating red tape agencies actively responding wildfires. joined Representative Huffman introduce amendment directly addressed risk wildfires. incorporated provisions based on: Representatives Simpson's Schrader's Wildfire Disaster Funding Act land management agencies access funding fight wildfires jeopardizing agency programs; Legislation dropped companion bill Senators Cantwell's Risch's Wildland Fires Act, provides funding help communities prepare wildfires target high-risk prescribed burns. gentleman Nevada (Mr. Amodei) coauthor legislation; incorporated Representatives LaMalfa's Schrader's Electricity Reliability Forest Protection Act, passed House earlier year, allows hazardous vegetation management Federal lands abut electrical transmission lines; incorporated Representative Ruiz's Wildfire Prevention Act allows apply hazard mitigation grants wildfire prevention projects. Instead considering controversial measures meet a dead Senate, pass bipartisan, practical, effective solutions. fires tore excuse undermine fundamental environmental laws protect public lands. motivate protect communities devastation constituents facing today.


Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, yield 4 minutes distinguished gentleman Oregon (Mr. Schrader).


Mr. SCHRADER.

That's a question. doubt it. doubt . . . cares tax return except reporters. Oh, some I'll release them. Maybe I'll release I'm finished. . . .'' right, Mr. Speaker, wait Trump leaves office money thanks own tax reform bill. Republican friends apparently fine that. a shocker. don't care Donald Trump using office enrich himself. don't care can't certainty exactly richer get. don't care debt. don't care deficit. don't care tax system fairer. Literally, care truly matters House Republicans cut taxes richest Americans, people a tax cut all.
